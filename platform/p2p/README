Introduction
============

wpa_supplicant has support for p2p networking (i.e., wifi direct).  This
document describes how to set up and test this p2p networking.  At the time of
this writing, only the ath9k driver supports wpa_supplicant's p2p.  So start by
building wireless-testing HEAD kernel with ath9k.  You'll also need a recent
wpa_supplicant.  See http://wireless.kernel.org/en/developers/p2p/howto for
details on building these pieces.  I've decided not to provide details here in
this README because the p2p stuff is under heavy development.  So the details
are likely to change.
